# Machine Learning and Statistical Methods for Business Analytics
### <center> IDS 575 </center> 


## Overview

The goal of this class is to cover the foundations of modern statistics and machine learning methods complementing the data mining focus of IDS 572. In other words, you will get up to speed with the requisite background, as well as the key theoretical underpinnings of modern analytics. We will do so through the lens of statistical machine learning. Lectures will be complemented with hands-on exercises.

## Assignments and Project

### Groups

You should form groups of (strictly) 4 students for the assignment and project components. Reach out to your classmates early. [Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1skD4q-x_sj__9CUuzT41t1QGZwHflD-RyjExpOVl8Mk/edit?usp=sharing) is a spreadsheet to facilitate this.


### Assignments

There will be five assignments, released on Github. These involve reimplementing statistical techniques and understanding their behavior on interesting datasets.  Always mention external sources used in your assignment solutions. Submission deadline is BEFORE 11.59 PM on the concerned day. Late submissions will have an automatic 20% penalty per day, and no extensions are available. Use [Blackboard](https://uic.blackboard.com/) for uploads. Because this is a group assignment, a commensurate effort is expected, and each member's contributions needs to be reported in the final submission.

### Project

The objective will be to demonstrate mastery over data ingestion, processing, prediction modeling and communication of key results. A suitable documentation of this process along with the complete set of scripts/codes/dataset samples/commands used is to be submitted. See the [project page](project.md) for more detailed instructions. Because this is a group project, a commensurate effort is expected, and each member's contributions needs to be reported in the final submission.


## Grades

 - Assignments: 12% + 12% + 12% + 12% + 12% 
 - Project: 5% for intermediate report and 30% for the final (more details in the project page linked above)
 - Course participation: 5% (includes but is not limited to attendance, interaction with the instructor and the TA, and how well you support your group).
